# What is Apache Hive?

Apache Hive is a data warehousing service and SQL-like query language (HiveQL) built on top of Hadoop.
It enables users to analyze and query large datasets stored in Hadoopâ€™s HDFS using a SQL-like interface.
Hive simplifies the process of querying and managing large datasets without requiring in-depth knowledge of Java or MapReduce.
It converts HQL query into Map-Reduce code.


## Key Features of Hive:
- SQL-like Interface: HiveQL (Hive Query Language) is similar to SQL.
- Data Warehousing: Allows users to store and query structured data.
- Scalability: Designed to work with large datasets stored in HDFS.
- Batch Processing: It is optimized for batch processing rather than real-time analytics.
- Schema on Read: Data is interpreted at query time, not when it is loaded into Hive.
