# What is Apache Hive?

Apache Hive is a data warehousing service and SQL-like query language (HiveQL) built on top of Hadoop.
It enables users to analyze and query large datasets stored in Hadoopâ€™s HDFS using a SQL-like interface.
Hive simplifies the process of querying and managing large datasets without requiring in-depth knowledge of Java or MapReduce.
It converts HQL query into Map-Reduce code.


## Key Features of Hive:
- SQL-like Interface: HiveQL (Hive Query Language) is similar to SQL.
- Data Warehousing: Allows users to store and query structured data.
- Scalability: Designed to work with large datasets stored in HDFS.
- Batch Processing: It is optimized for batch processing rather than real-time analytics.
- Schema on Read: Data is interpreted at query time, not when it is loaded into Hive.


## Apache Hive Architecture

The architecture of Apache Hive is designed to process and manage large datasets stored in Hadoop's HDFS using SQL-like queries

**Hive Client:**
- Hive drivers support applications written in any language like Python, Java, C++, and Ruby, among others, using JDBC, ODBC, and Thrift drivers, to perform queries on the Hive. Therefore, one may design a hive client in any language of their choice.
- The three types of Hive clients are referred to as Hive clients:
  - `Thrift Clients`: The Hive server can handle requests from a thrift client by using Apache Thrift.
  - `JDBC client`: A JDBC driver connects to Hive using the Thrift framework. Hive Server communicates with the Java applications using the JDBC driver.
  - `ODBC client`: The Hive ODBC driver is similar to the JDBC driver in that it uses Thrift to connect to Hive. However, the ODBC driver uses the Hive Server to communicate with it instead of the Hive Server.


**Hive Services:**

Hive provides numerous services, including the Hive server2, Beeline, etc. The services offered by Hive are:
- `Beeline`: HiveServer2 supports the Beeline, a command shell that which the user can submit commands and queries to. It is a JDBC client that utilises SQLLINE CLI (a pure Java console utility for connecting with relational databases and executing SQL queries). The Beeline is based on JDBC.
- `Hive Server 2`: HiveServer2 is the successor to HiveServer1. It provides clients with the ability to execute queries against the Hive. Multiple clients may submit queries to Hive and obtain the desired results. Open API clients such as JDBC and ODBC are supported by HiveServer2.

***Note***: Hive server1, which is also known as a Thrift server, is used to communicate with Hive across platforms. Different client applications can submit requests to Hive and receive the results using this server.

HiveServer2 handled concurrent requests from more than one client, so it was replaced by HiveServer1.
