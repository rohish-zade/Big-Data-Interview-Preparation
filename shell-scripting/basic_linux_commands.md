  **difference between Archiving and Compressing:**

  | Feature             | Archiving                                          |   Compressing                                         |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|  ----------------------------------------------------|
  | **Definition**       | Combines multiple files into a single file without reducing size. |   Reduces the size of one or more files by encoding data more efficiently. |
  | **Purpose**          | Organize and store multiple files in one place.   | Save disk space   or reduce transfer time by making files smaller.          |
  | **File Structure**   | Maintains the original structure of the files.    | Changes the   internal structure to reduce file size. |
  | **Tools**            | `tar`, `cpio`, `7-zip` (for archiving)            | `gzip`, `bzip2`,   `zip`, `7z`, `xz`                 |
  | **Formats**          | `.tar`, `.iso`                                    | `.zip`, `.gz`, `.  bz2`, `.7z`, `.xz`                |
  | **Combination**      | Often combined with compression (e.g., `.tar.gz`).| Compression is   typically done after archiving.     |
  | **Use Case**         | Backup or group files for easier management or distribution. | Save   disk space or speed up file transfer.         |
  | **Restoring Files**  | Files are extracted while maintaining structure.  | Files are   decompressed and restored to original size. |


### 8. User and Group Management
- `whoami`: Display the current logged-in user.
  ```bash
  whoami
  ```

- `id`:	Display user and group IDs	
  ```bash
  id username # show user and group IDs for username
  ```

- `sudo`: Run a command with superuser privileges
  ```bash
  sudo command    # Run a command as the superuser
  ```

- `useradd`: Add a new user.
  ```bash
  sudo useradd username
  ```

- `passwd` username
  ```bash
  passwd username
  ```
