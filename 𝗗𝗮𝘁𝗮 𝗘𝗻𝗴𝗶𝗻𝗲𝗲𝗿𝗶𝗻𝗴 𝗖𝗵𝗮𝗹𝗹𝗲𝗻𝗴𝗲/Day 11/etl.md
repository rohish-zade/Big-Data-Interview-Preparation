- A) Using print statements
- B) Implementing structured logging
- C) Manually reviewing database tables
- D) Re-running failed jobs without logs

**Ans:** B) Implementing structured logging

**Explanation:**

- This involves logging data in a consistent, machine-readable format (often JSON).   
- It allows for easy searching, filtering, and analysis of logs.   
- It provides context and detail about errors, making it easier to diagnose and troubleshoot issues in an ETL pipeline
