## ETL Challenge: ETL Error handling

### Which approach is best for handling errors in an ETL pipeline?
- A) Logging errors and retrying
- B) Skipping the failed record
- C) Stopping the pipeline entirely
- D) All of the above

**Ans:** D) All of the above

**Explanation:**
- The best approach for handling errors in an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline depends on the type and severity of the error. Different scenarios require different strategies:
  - **Logging errors and retrying (A):** Best for temporary issues like network failures or database locks. Implementing retries with exponential backoff can help.
  - **Skipping the failed record (B):** Useful for handling bad data, such as corrupt or missing values, while allowing the pipeline to continue processing.
  - **Stopping the pipeline entirely (C):**  Necessary when critical errors occur, such as schema mismatches or system-wide failures, to prevent corrupt data from being processed.
