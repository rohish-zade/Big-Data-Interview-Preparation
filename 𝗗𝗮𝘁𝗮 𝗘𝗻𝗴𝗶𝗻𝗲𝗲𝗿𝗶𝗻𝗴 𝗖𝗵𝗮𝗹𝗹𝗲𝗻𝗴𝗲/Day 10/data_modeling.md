## Data Modeling Challenge: Entity-Relationship Diagrams

### Which symbol represents a many-to-one relationship in an ER diagram?

- A) Crow's foot
- B) Double line
- C) Dashed line
- D) Solid arrow

**Ans:** B) Double line

**Explanation:**
#### Many-to-One Relationship in ER Diagram

In an **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram**, a **many-to-one (M:1) relationship** is represented using:

- A **crow’s foot** (three prongs) at the **many** side.  
- A **single line** at the **one** side.  

This notation is part of **Crow's Foot Notation**, widely used for ER diagrams.

#### Why Not Other Options?

- **B) Double line** → Represents a **total participation** constraint, not cardinality.  
- **C) Dashed line** → Used for **weak entity relationships**, not cardinality.  
- **D) Solid arrow** → Not a standard notation for M:1 relationships.
