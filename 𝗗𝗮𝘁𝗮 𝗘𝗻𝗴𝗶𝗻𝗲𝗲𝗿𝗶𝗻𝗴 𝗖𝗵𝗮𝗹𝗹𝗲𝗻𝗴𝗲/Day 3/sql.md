## SQL Challenge: Indexes and Performance

### Which of the following SQL queries will benefit the most from an index on the email column of the users table?
- SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='test@email.com'
- SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY email
- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
- All of the above

**Ans:** SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='test@email.com'

**Explanation:**
- `Indexes and WHERE Clauses:` Indexes are primarily used to speed up data retrieval when filtering data using WHERE clauses. In this case, the query is specifically searching for a user with a specific email address. An index on the email column will allow the database to quickly locate the matching row(s) without scanning the entire table.
- ***Why the other options are less beneficial:***
  - `SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY email:` While an index can help with sorting, it's not the primary use case for an index. The database might still need to perform a sort operation, even with an index.
  - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users:` This query counts all rows in the table. An index on the email column won't significantly improve the performance of a full table count.
  - `All of the above:` As explained, not all queries benefit equally from an index.
