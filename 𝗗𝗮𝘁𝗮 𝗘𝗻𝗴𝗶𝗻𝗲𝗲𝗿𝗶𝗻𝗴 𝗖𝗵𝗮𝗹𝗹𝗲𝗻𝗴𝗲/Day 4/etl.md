## ETL Challenge: Data Validation in ETL

###  Which validation technique is most effective in ETL pipelines?
- A) Schema validation
- B) NULL checks
- C) Referential integrity constraints
- D) All of the above

**Ans:** D) All of the above.

**Explanation:**
- `Schema validation:` Ensures that the data conforms to the expected structure and data types. This is crucial for preventing data corruption and ensuring consistency.
- `NULL checks:` Identifies missing or incomplete data, which can lead to errors in downstream processes.
- `Referential integrity constraints:` Verifies that relationships between tables are maintained, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
