## Python Challenge: Multithreading

### Which module in Python is used for multithreading?

- A) threading
- B) multiprocessing
- C) asyncio
- D) parallel

**Ans:** A) threading


**Explanation:**
- The `threading` module in Python is used for multithreading, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently within the same process. It is commonly used for I/O-bound tasks.
- For CPU-bound tasks, the `multiprocessing` module (B) is more suitable as it creates separate processes.
